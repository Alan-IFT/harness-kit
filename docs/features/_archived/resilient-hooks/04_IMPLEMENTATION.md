# Development Record — T-12 `resilient-hooks` (v0.44.0)

## Summary

Made the harness lifecycle hooks resilient at the wiring layer (slice A) and stopped this repo
from distributing its own dogfood hooks (slice B). The three convenience hooks
(Stop→harness-sync, UserPromptSubmit→ambient-prompt, SessionStart→ambient-reset) are now
**fail-OPEN** + `$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR`-anchored; the safety hook (PreToolUse→guard-rm) is
resilient-anchored but stays **fail-CLOSED**. The `/harness-upgrade` + `migrate-scripts-layout`
repair paths now rewrite a pre-existing brittle command into the resilient form (A8). The repo's
dogfood hooks moved from the committed `.claude/settings.json` into a gitignored
`.claude/settings.local.json`. `verify_all.sh` reaches **32/0/0**.

## Files changed

### Slice A — resilient command form + repair path + ripple
- `skills/harness-init/templates/common/.harness/scripts/upgrade-project.sh` — added `resilient_cmd` +
  ampersand-safe `str_replace_all` helpers; S3.0 placeholder repair now emits the resilient form; new
  S3.2 brittle→resilient rewrite (after S3.1, gated on `target_present`, idempotent via double-quote-
  bounded needle).
- `skills/harness-init/templates/common/.harness/scripts/upgrade-project.ps1` — twin (`Get-ResilientCmd`,
  S3.0/S3.1/S3.2; `.Replace()` is already literal so no `&` hazard).
- `skills/harness-init/templates/common/.harness/scripts/migrate-scripts-layout.sh` — added
  `resilient_cmd` + `str_replace_all`; brittle→resilient step after the prefix rewire.
- `skills/harness-init/templates/common/.harness/scripts/migrate-scripts-layout.ps1` — twin.
- `.harness/scripts/{upgrade-project,migrate-scripts-layout}.{ps1,sh}` — propagated byte-identical from
  the four template-common sources via `sync-self` (C1; 8-file lockstep — E.1 green).
- `skills/harness-init/SKILL.md` — step-5 `{{…}}_COMMAND` table rows → resilient strings (both OS,
  JSON-escaped), convenience fail-open vs guard fail-closed, token-survival note.
- `skills/harness-adopt/SKILL.md` — step-6 substitution table rows → resilient (reference init step 5).
- `skills/harness-status/SKILL.md` — §3c "How to compute": one-block clarification that the resilient
  anchor preserves the extractable `.harness/scripts/<name>.<ext>` token (no logic flip).
- `.harness/scripts/test-init.{sh,ps1}` — `*_COMMAND` literals → JSON-escaped resilient (C3);
  substitution switched from sed/`-replace` to a literal, metachar-safe replace (the resilient values
  carry `&`/`|`/`;`/`$env`); `test_migrate` block updated + resilient/fail-closed asserts added (C2).
- `.harness/scripts/test-harness-upgrade.{sh,ps1}` — `t20_pick` → JSON-escaped resilient (C3); `p_target`
  switched to ERE token extraction; Fixture P/H real-run probe sets `CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR` (C5/F4);
  Fixture A/H/M2 gained resilient + guard-fail-closed asserts (A8 proof).

### Slice B — stop distributing dogfood hooks
- `.claude/settings.json` (committed) — `hooks` stripped to `{}`; `_hooks_moved` doc key added;
  permissions retained (B2 / OQ-4a).
- `.claude/settings.local.json` (NEW, gitignored) — the four resilient pwsh dogfood hooks (A9 / B1 / B4).
- `.gitignore` — added `.claude/settings.local.json` (B3 / AC-10).
- `.harness/scripts/verify_all.{sh,ps1}` — F.2 reads guard-rm evidence from settings.local.json
  (fallback to settings.json); J.1 adds `.claude/settings.local.json` as a target (C4 / B5).

### Version fan-out (G.3/G.4) + docs
- `.claude-plugin/plugin.json`, `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` — version 0.43.0 → 0.44.0.
- `README.md`, `README.zh-CN.md` — version badge → 0.44.0.
- `CHANGELOG.md` — new `## [0.44.0]` heading + entry.
- `docs/dev-map.md` — `.claude/` section: committed-settings (empty hooks) + gitignored
  settings.local.json dogfood entry.
- `.harness/rules/75-safety-hook.md` — dogfood relocation note (C5, non-blocking).

**Count:** 24 tracked files + 1 gitignored new file (`.claude/settings.local.json`) = 25 files for T-12.
(`docs/batches/default/{BATCH_PLAN,STREAM_LOG}.md` also show modified — stream-orchestrator bookkeeping,
not part of this implementation.)

## How each AC was satisfied

- **AC-1 (fail-open reproduce-the-bug)** — runtime-verified: missing convenience script → `rc=0`, empty
  stderr (the consumer's `rc=127` → resilient `rc=0`).
- **AC-2 (anchor)** — runtime-verified: invoking the wired Stop command from a subdirectory resolves +
  runs the script (`rc=0`, output `ran`). test-harness-upgrade Fixture P/H real-run probes (with
  `CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR` set) exercise the same path.
- **AC-3 (both OSes)** — exact Unix + Windows strings in design §3.5 reproduced character-for-character by
  `resilient_cmd`/`Get-ResilientCmd` (bash output verified byte-equal to the design + to on-disk settings).
- **AC-4 (ambient parity)** — ambient-prompt/-reset carry the identical fail-open resilient form;
  test-init `[T-020] ambient-* command is the OS-picked variant` exact-match passes against the resilient
  literal.
- **AC-5 (guard-rm fail-CLOSED — safety invariant)** — runtime-verified: missing guard-rm → `rc=127`
  (non-zero = blocked); guard resilient form has NO `exit 0` fallback (asserted in Fixture A + migrate +
  empty-var probe).
- **AC-6 (template)** — `.tmpl` body unchanged (placeholders carry the resilient form via substitution);
  J.1 PASS on the substituted output (test-init green); J.1 PASS on the dogfood files.
- **AC-7 (derivation lockstep)** — init step-5 table, adopt step-6 table, and the upgrade/migrate
  `ph_cmd`/S3.2 all emit the same resilient bytes; no surviving brittle convenience form for the
  authoring sites (the only bare-brittle literals remaining are the OLD-form FIXTURES and the S3.2
  needles, which is correct).
- **AC-8 (repair)** — Fixture A (pre-T-007 brittle) + Fixture H (dangling bare) both rewrite to the
  resilient form (CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR-anchored), `$schema` canonical, one `.bak`, second run NOOP (no
  new `.bak`) — verified in test-harness-upgrade.sh 85/0.
- **AC-9 (B1/B2 move)** — committed settings.json has `"hooks": {}` + `_hooks_moved`; the four hooks are
  in settings.local.json in the resilient pwsh form.
- **AC-10 (gitignore)** — `git check-ignore` confirms `.claude/settings.local.json` is ignored; not in
  `git status`.
- **AC-11 (verify_all unaffected)** — F.2 + J.1 PASS post-slice-B (settings.local.json fallback);
  full verify_all.sh = 32/0/0.
- **AC-12 (ripple — #1 risk)** — OQ-3a holds: the resilient token is still ERE-parseable +
  cwd-resolvable. test-init `[T-020] every settings hook command path exists` PASS, mutation probe
  (deleted harness-sync.* → reported dangling) PASS; Fixture I (incongruent) still exits 4; E.4b/D.4b
  template scans 0-edit and green.
- **AC-13 (gate)** — verify_all.sh = **32/0/0** (PS twin operator-pending; green-by-symmetry).
- **AC-14 (count/version)** — 0.44.0 fan-out (plugin/marketplace/2 READMEs + CHANGELOG heading); no
  check-count flip (32), skills 17 / agents 8 unchanged; G.3 + G.4 PASS.

## Gate conditions C1–C4 (binding) + C5

- **C1 (8-file lockstep — DONE, E.1 green).** Edited the four `templates/common/.harness/scripts/`
  sources for upgrade-project + migrate-scripts-layout, then ran `bash .harness/scripts/sync-self.sh`
  (non-check) to propagate to the four repo copies byte-identically. `sync-self.sh --check` = "In sync.";
  verify_all E.1 PASS.
- **C2 (test_migrate — DONE).** Updated the `test_migrate` block in test-init.{sh,ps1}: the Stop/
  PreToolUse `grep -qF` substring asserts survive (resilient form embeds the inner `& pwsh … -File …`);
  added explicit "commands are the resilient form (CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR-anchored)" + "guard-rm fail-CLOSED
  (no exit 0)" asserts; the `_doc_sync_hook` mask-test and `-NoProfile >= 2` count re-validated against
  the new form (PS `-eq` exact-match updated to the resilient value since ConvertFrom-Json un-escapes).
- **C3 (JSON-escaped literals — DONE).** `t20_pick` (test-harness-upgrade) + all `*_COMMAND`
  (test-init) literals hold the JSON-escaped resilient bytes (inner `"` as `\"`), verified byte-equal to
  on-disk settings. Fixture P's `p_target` switched from last-token to the left-bounded ERE extraction.
- **C4 (F.2 fallback — DONE).** F.2 in both shells reads the guard-rm PreToolUse evidence from
  `.claude/settings.local.json` when it carries hooks, else falls back to settings.json. J.1 adds
  settings.local.json as a target. F.2 + J.1 PASS post-slice-B.
- **C5 (advisory — DONE).** Fixture P/H real-run probes set `CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR` to the fixture root
  (exercising the real-run path, not the fail-open empty-var path). 75-safety-hook.md refreshed with the
  dogfood relocation note.

## verify_all result
- Baseline (pre-change): PASS 32 / WARN 0 / FAIL 0.
- After changes: PASS 32 / WARN 0 / FAIL 0.
- Delta: 0 new failures; baseline preserved. Regression drivers green: test-init.sh 278/0,
  test-harness-upgrade.sh 85/0 (+6 resilient asserts), test-supervisor.sh 45/0, test-verify-i6.sh 58/0,
  test-language.sh 39/0, test-real-project.sh 90/0.

## Design drift (flagged for reviewer)

1. **`DESIGN DRIFT` (minor, runtime-only) — `cd ""` with an EMPTY `$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR`.** The design
   (OQ-2a) claims `cd ""` *fails* (empty operand) so the convenience hook no-ops. On this bash, `cd ""`
   stays in cwd and succeeds, so the convenience hook may run against cwd instead of no-op'ing. This is
   still a SAFE fail-open degradation (exit 0, no crash, no FS-root cd), and `$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR` is
   always injected by Claude Code in practice (empty-var is not the reported failure mode). The SAFETY
   half is unaffected: guard-rm with empty var + missing script still fails closed (rc=127, verified).
   No code change made; flagging for reviewer awareness.

2. **`str_replace_all` helper added (not in design's edit list).** The design specified raw-text
   substring replacement but did not anticipate **bash 5.2's `&`-means-matched-text** rule in
   `${var//pat/repl}` — the resilient command contains a literal `&` (`& pwsh`) which `${//}` expanded to
   the match, corrupting the JSON. Added an ampersand-safe split-and-concat helper in both `.sh` scripts
   (and reused the same pattern in test-init.sh's `ti_replace_all`). The PS twins use `.Replace()` which
   is already literal. This is a defect-prevention addition, not a behavior change vs. the design intent.

## Open issues for review

- **PS twins are green-by-symmetry, not executed.** PowerShell is denied to this agent, so
  `verify_all.ps1`, `test-init.ps1`, `test-harness-upgrade.ps1` were edited symmetrically with the bash
  twins (which all pass) but NOT run. Operator should run them to confirm. Items to spot-check on the PS
  run: (a) `Get-ResilientCmd` `-f` format-string brace-doubling produces the exact resilient bytes;
  (b) the literal `.Replace()` substitution (not `-replace`) leaves `$env:`/`$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR` intact;
  (c) the migrate `-eq` exact-match against the un-escaped resilient value; (d) Fixture P/H/A/M2 resilient
  asserts.
- **context7 NFR-Compat re-verification not performed by me.** The design (§3.6) asks the Developer to
  re-confirm via context7 that `$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR` is injected into all four hook events. The context7
  MCP was not Bash-accessible in this sub-agent harness. Non-blocking: the design + Gate already
  established this (mattpocock/git-guardrails cite), and the form degrades safely either way (convenience
  no-ops, guard fails closed) if the var were ever absent. Operator may confirm at review.

## Dev-map updates

Added under the `.claude/` tree:
- `settings.json` — committed: permissions + EMPTY hooks (T-12 v0.44: dogfood hooks relocated).
- `settings.local.json` — GITIGNORED dogfood hooks (4 resilient lifecycle hooks; local-dev precedence).

## Insight to surface

bash 5.2 treats `&` in the replacement string of `${var//pat/repl}` as "the matched text" (sed-style),
so a raw-text settings rewriter whose replacement value contains a literal `&` (the resilient hook's
`& pwsh`) silently corrupts output; use a split-and-concat literal replace (or PS `.Replace()`, already
literal) for any cross-shell pair that substitutes `&`-bearing values. · evidence: T-12,
upgrade-project.sh `str_replace_all` + the first-run corrupted-JSON repro

## Fidelity fix (post-CR)

The code-reviewer APPROVED-WITH-NITS and flagged 3 MINOR test-fidelity gaps: three live
fixture-**authoring** sites still substituted the four `{{…}}_COMMAND` placeholders with the OLD
**brittle** hook form (`bash …/harness-sync.sh`, `pwsh -File …/harness-sync.ps1`) instead of the
new **resilient** form. Because these sites build a fixture's FINAL settings (not OLD-form fixtures
meant to be upgraded), they made AC-7 inaccurate and weakened the test-real-project dogfooding.

The 3 sites were fixed by copying the EXACT resilient literals already in `test-init.{sh,ps1}`
(byte-identical — verified by `diff` of the 8 bash `*_COMMAND` assignments). No product code, no
resilient command design, nothing else touched.

- `.harness/scripts/test-real-project.sh` — `*_COMMAND` values → JSON-escaped resilient literals;
  substitution switched from sed (metachar-unsafe for `&`/`|`/`;`/`{`/`}`) to the `ti_replace_all`
  literal split-and-concat helper (mirrored from test-init.sh) for the four command placeholders;
  scalar placeholders stay on sed.
- `.harness/scripts/test-real-project.ps1` — `*_COMMAND` values → resilient literals; the `&`/`$env:`
  bytes are safe because `Copy-TemplateLayer` uses `.Replace()` (ordinal-literal), not `-replace`.
- `.harness/scripts/test-init.ps1` `Test-ZhOverlay` — zh-overlay `*_COMMAND` values → resilient
  literals; the overlay substitution path also uses `.Replace()` (ordinal-literal, `&`-safe).

**guard-rm stayed fail-CLOSED** in the new literals (NO `|| exit 0` / NO `; exit 0` fallback) on
both OSes; the three convenience hooks are fail-OPEN + `$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR`-anchored. Verified
against the emitted fixture settings: the `& pwsh` ampersand survived intact (no `${//}`-style
corruption), guard-rm ends with `guard-rm.ps1\"` (no exit-0), convenience hooks end with
`}; exit 0\"`.

**AC-7 is now fully met**: no surviving brittle authoring form for the convenience hooks across the
init/adopt/upgrade/migrate emitters AND the three fixture-authoring test sites. The only remaining
bare-brittle literals are the OLD-form FIXTURES and the S3.2 brittle→resilient needles, which is
correct.

Re-verified tallies (bash):
- `verify_all.sh` = **32 / 0 / 0** (unchanged baseline).
- `test-real-project.sh` = **90 / 0** (green, unchanged count).
- `.ps1` twins (test-real-project.ps1, test-init.ps1 Test-ZhOverlay) edited symmetrically with the
  byte-identical resilient literals; green-by-symmetry, operator-pending (PowerShell denied to this
  agent — no PS tallies fabricated).

## Verdict
READY FOR REVIEW
